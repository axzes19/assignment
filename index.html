                    <p>The leader of the Axzes clan has created a clan 2 years ago. From the very beginning there was a goal to achieve the promotion of our name to cyber arena. The very beginning of the path as always happened. Long searched for good and adequate players and a year later, our team began their way in various tournaments at the head of our leader.</p>

                    <p>The leadership of the clan went through various checks for a very long time and the selection was very strict, but we managed to assemble a team of leaders who go about their business, which were distributed by the leader of the clan.After some time, thanks to our efforts, we began to gain popularity and began to call for tournaments that had cash prizes and top players played on them</p>

                    <p>Our first manager is DEVIL.  She has been in the clan almost since its inception and a lot of work on recruiting people and content.  Every day there is almost a recruitment and verification of each player, but not all fit.  The recruitment is very strict and, for example, out of 30 people will pass somewhere 3. To pass the checks, the manager himself plays several games with each of them and draws conclusions, but does not make decisions without the permission of the leader</p>

                 <p>Second manager Elman.  He's not an easy task.  he has to organize various tournaments and register our team for tournaments from other organizations.  it's not difficult, just a little boring but important.  Without this work, we would not have been able to participate in tournaments, win them and gain popularity.</p>
