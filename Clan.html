Long searched for good and adequate players and a year later, our team began their way in various tournaments at the head of our leader.After some time, thanks to our efforts, we began to gain popularity and began to call for tournaments that had cash prizes and top players played on them.our first victory brought the team $ 100 for each player and the team has 4 to 6 players.  of course we often participated in such tournaments and of course there were victories and defeats.
